- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoeOctober. My first name really is Joe so we can keep it at that.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about python and getting a few projects going that will help me build experience and a portfolio for the language. Discord Bots and Discord Text Based Bots interest me as well. 
- Outside of coding things, I am a proud member of KarmaFleet in the Imperium in the MMO Eve Online and a skilled photographer. Expanding my realm into video editing... SOON. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, pandas, some statistical mathmatics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simplier projects to practice Data Visualization.
- 📫 How to reach me -- I can be reached at jvgora@icloud.com.
